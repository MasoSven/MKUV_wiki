Welcome to <del>Hell</del> MKUV. If you&#039;re reading this you&#039;ve probably just woke up in Your Bathroom and are feeling very lost and confused.
</p>

<p>
The highlighted text in every room indicates any objects you can interact with. Your first command to learn is <code>examine x</code> (can shortened to <code>ex x</code>). This brings up relevant commands for any specified object you want to interact with. Object names can be shortened as well.
</p>

<p>
While you&#039;re here you may want to think about setting your character&#039;s description. Simply type <code>@describe me as x</code> to set what people see when they look at you. 
</p>

<p>
The rules for character descriptions are very lax, but good creativity and proper sentence structure are always appreciated. If you&#039;re feeling particularly creative you can also type <code>help @describe</code> to learn how to set descriptions for every naked part of your body. There&#039;s no need to worry about any of this now though as you can always change your descriptions later.
</p>

<p>
If you have any experience from HellMOO you&#039;ll definitely want to take the time to <code>read</code> that notice. Otherwise, walk out into The Dreams of Before with the <code>east</code> (or <code>e</code>) command

<p>
The Dreams of Before are exactly that, a disjointed dream about the way things were before the nuclear bombs hit and destroyed society as we once knew it. This is also part of the MKUV character generation stage, where you collect 4 items that determine your starting <a href="/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=basics:skills" class="wikilink1" title="basics:skills" data-wiki-id="basics:skills">skills</a>.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The items you pick up will teach you the first raw in their associated <a href="/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=basics:skills" class="wikilink1" title="basics:skills" data-wiki-id="basics:skills">skill</a> and slightly decrease the xp cost of learning that skill all the way to its max at 15 (This is often referred to by players as “tagging” a skill). With that in mind you should only tag skills you intend to train very high.
</p>

<p>
For your first character it is highly recommended that you tag one weapon skill and only one. It is hard to go wrong with your other 3 tags, but some good utilities to start with would include medic, repair, or scavenge. Focus is also a useful utility despite being in the weapons category as it affects your ability to use focus and movement <a href="/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=basics:mutations" class="wikilink1" title="basics:mutations" data-wiki-id="basics:mutations">mutations</a> later on. Tagging dodge is unfortunately not an option.
</p>

<p>
You may take as much time as you want here to think about the skills you want to tag. Don&#039;t worry if you change your mind later. You&#039;ll find that tagging a skill doesn&#039;t actually have a large impact on your character&#039;s ability to learn it. Once you&#039;ve figured it out head <code>d</code> to proceed.

<p>
The playgirl and playboy magazines here will add 10.00 fetish IPs to your men and women fetishes respectively and you are allowed to take both. This doesn&#039;t actually mechanically increase your character&#039;s attraction to either sex. Your fetish scores merely keep track of how much you&#039;ve looked at a given fetish. You can view your current fetish scores with <code>sx</code>.

<h2 class="sectionedit3" id="dreams_of_below">Dreams of Below</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
This segment of dreams is where you learn about combat and decide on your <a href="/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=basics:stats" class="wikilink1" title="basics:stats" data-wiki-id="basics:stats">stat</a> distribution.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/dokuwiki/lib/exe/detail.php?id=basics%3Atutorial&amp;media=basics:ivplgowgyn.png" class="media" title="basics:ivplgowgyn.png"><img src="/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=basics:ivplgowgyn.png" class="media" loading="lazy" alt="" /></a>
</p>

<p>
All of your <a href="/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=basics:stats" class="wikilink1" title="basics:stats" data-wiki-id="basics:stats">stats</a> start at 8 raw and max out at 18 raw (though you can&#039;t raise them higher than 14 in chargen). By using the machines in the bunker you will gain a raw in the related stat. 
</p>

<p>
It is typically unwise to split your points among more than 3 stats unless you really know what you&#039;re doing. Your first two stats to max should be what your main weapon <a href="/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=basics:skills" class="wikilink1" title="basics:skills" data-wiki-id="basics:skills">skill</a> depends on. (Ex; If you use blades, max reflexes and cool. If you use whips, max reflexes and senses).
</p>

<p>
Points that go into your third stat are what sets your build apart from someone else that uses the same weapon as you. Some people put the rest into brawn for higher damage scaling, some put invest in brains for extra support and utility capabilities, some go for senses for the survivability from higher dodge.
