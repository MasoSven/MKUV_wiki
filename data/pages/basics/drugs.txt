Drugs in MKUV are much like potions and poisons in other games: Substances which alter your character's stats or state of being in some way. Some are common, some are rare, some are dangerous, some are quite benign, some are useful, and some are just plain dumb, but they're all worth knowing about.

The term "drug" in MKUV is applied loosely; it can refer to actual narcotics, other intoxicants, poisons, and many other effects that may seem surprising. This can be confusing at first, but the rule of thumb is this: If it's a temporary effect that uses the Heartbeat system, like nicotine, it's considered a "drug." If it's a static effect that doesn't use the heartbeat system and has its existence controlled by something else, such as +2 science from a lab coat (controlled by wearing it or not wearing it), then it's a buff or debuff.
=====Stat Drugs=====
These drugs are the most important type: They affect stats in some way. There are many of them, so they're organized in a neat table below. Most of it is straightforward reading, but note that the OD threshold is where something bad is guaranteed; unless otherwise stated, the penalty for overdosing is instant death. 5 doses of cocaine, for example, will kill anyone that is not an [[Abomination]] since Aboms ignore many OD thresholds.

You will also see a frequent abbreviation in this graph: phb. This stands for "Per HeartBeat", which means that the effect procs every [[heartbeat]]. See the linked article for more information on heartbeats.

=====Withdrawal, Overdoses and Heart Attacks=====
Doing hard drugs while having low Endurance is a Bad Idea since you can suffer possibly fatal heart attacks. (Though aspirin and the Jarvik 24 heart Implant can help with that.)

Whenever you take a dose of a drug that can cause withdrawal (like crank), you will also have a chance (rolled against your endurance) of gaining a dose of "withdrawal". This shows up as being "strung out" on your status prompt. There is no way to measure this; you'll either have it or you won't. Every dose of withdrawal increases your chance of having a random heart attack, and the doses don't start to decay until after all the buffs from your drug wear off. Most of the buffs from drugs can be removed quickly by a medic with a detox kit.

It is possible to have two messages of "strung out" on your status prompt if you are strung out from both crank and cocaine. High endurance, or zombie's addiction resistance, will give you a much higher chance to shrug off withdrawal doses. Some heart attacks can be shrugged off with high enough endurance or negated by the zombie mutation or a Jarvik-24 heart implant.

Taking too many doses of certain drugs (cocaine has a cap at 5 doses for example) will result in an instant death by overdose unless you're a hideous abomination.
=====Hallucinogens=====
These pills all cause unconsciousness, so use them with proper discretion.

| Q-tablet        | Bought from Barry's Rainbow Dream Emporium for 15 dollars a pop. They allow entrance into the Quake world, a mental realm modeled after the famous Quake FPS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Blue Horsepill  | Bought from Barry's Rainbow Dream Emporium. It's possibly a reference to the Blue pill in the matrix and transports you to a world where everything is weak and easy to kill. You gain no XP or IP (unconfirmed) by killing, but it is a good way to relieve stress.                                                                                                                   |
| Jerkpill        | Transports you to the jerk realm, an area consisting of two locations, under the sink and the surface of the moon. This area is inhabited by 3 talkative aliens who do little more than make puns and insult you. All three of them also allow sex, hooray! Also available at Barry's Rainbow Dream Emporium.                                                                          |
| House pill      | Transports you to your childhood home, where your father bitches at you. Depressing, but only costs 7 bucks at Barry's Rainbow Dream Emporium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Eyeball         | A candy eyeball bought in jars from Barry's Rainbow Dream Emporium for a tidy sum of 375 dollars. Transports you to Humanitymoo, a world of blind griefers and helpful people. Thankfully, it's effects are relatively short.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Old pill        | At 750 bucks a pop (from Barry's Rainbow Dream Emporium) the old pill is quite the expensive trip, though its also quite a long one. Brings you to the Museum of Oddities and allows you to explore, assuming you find the secret passage way into the building proper. Exhibits include a stuffed beefalo, a hyperintelligent flying penis and a book detailing the history of KREW.  |
| Healing cube    | Transports you to an area that's not supposed to exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
=====Other drugs=====
These affect stats or something else, rather than transporting you anywhere.
| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Rejuvex              | Lowers your character's age each dose. Only removes age gained by recloning, rather than natural aging. Effectiveness is massively reduced by the Fibrocartilage mutation.                                                                                         |
| Aspirin              | Helps old people and drug users survive heart attacks. Lasts for a fairly short time compared to most drugs.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rad-Q                | Protects from radiation sickness. Will not protect you from the irradiation damage type. Debuffs some stats, causes nausea, and occasionally stuns the user. Bad things happen if you take more than one of these at a time or take one while already irradiated.  |
| Black pill           | Curare. Paralyzes, very heavily debuffs stats, and can kill you. Always fun.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Birth control pills  | These decrease the chance of pregnancy (when taken by a woman, of course).                                                                                                                                                                                         |
