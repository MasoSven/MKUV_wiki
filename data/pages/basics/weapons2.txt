A thicker, longer barrel and receiver along with more robust internal mechanics have been designed to reduce overheating problems and improve automatic fire capabilities. A bipod is installed on the end of the barrel and the stock has also been redesigned for better comfort aiming in the prone position.                                                                                                                                              |

The firearm features a pistol grip and a simple cylindrical receiver which partially sheathes the barrel and acts as the buttstock while housing the massive bolt assembly. The absence of a mag well suggests that bullets are fed through the large side-ejection port one at a time. There are no iron sights present but a short length of raised picatinny rail has been welded to the top for mounting optics.  |

The frame and furniture is comprised of matte black polymer and aluminum, with an 8 round tube magazine under its 22 inch vent ribbed barrel and the expected accessory rails installed into the top of the receiver and either side of the muzzle. Its unique gas system has been engineered to reduce felt recoil and allow for faster follow up shots on harder targets.                                                                                                                 |

A butchered Street Sweeper revolver shotgun with its stock removed and barrel cut down two thirds from its original length, creating a compact 16-inch shot-revolving monstrosity. Though it seems to be intended for one-handed use the size reduction did little for its weight and the double action trigger pull remains as heavy as the original, demanding massive grit and forearm strength from its operator.                                                                                                                                                           |

A semi-automatic short barreled shotgun designed for very close quarters combat. Its frame and furniture is comprised of matte black polymer and aluminum, with a short 5 round tube magazine under its 13 inch vent ribbed barrel and the expected accessory rails installed into the top of the reciever and either side of the muzzle. The birdhead pistol grip and lack of a shoulder stock keeps its size down to a handy two feet in total length, tempting you to hold it with one hand, though it would probably take a skilled operator to actually fire it like that…  |
