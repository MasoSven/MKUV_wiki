======Armor======
Here is a list of the many armors included within the game. It is still a WIP, given that there are still many unrecorded items. A lot of this data comes from Hellmoo's armor archive, so some armors may be different compared to what is shown.

The maximum amount of armor you can layer on each part of your body cannot exceed more than 15 thickness, though Jewelry and some clothes do not count towards this.

Regardless of thickness mechanics, you cannot stack more than 4 items on your chest, 8 items on your hand, or 10 items in your face. Most footwear also cannot be stacked at all despite having thickness values less than 15.

Extremely high-value. Night vision and gas mask protection built in. Superb soaks for the head, which is harder to armor. Doses you with ATP like the Deathsuit. If you wear a deathsuit and a deathshead at the same time, you'll get double-dosed. Also has excellent irradiation soaks.  |

Great lowbie and Zombie armor. Awfully heavy and can become a deathtrap in water.Hint: improvise armor with tire                                                                                            |

Has built in auto-replenishing air supply, lights, automatic cooling/heating system and rad/toxic/cold/suffocation protection. Great for scavenging and general exploring.                                                                                |

Can be loaded with radioactive rods to lower the dodge penalty temporarily, and can discharge the bars for low damage to everyone in the room. Good for its excellent soaks on three exotic, unlisted damage types: radiation, irradiation, and wasting.  |

Slowly doses you with ATP but is very thin and has great soaks, especially against elec. Also has excellent irradiation soaks.                                                |

It's 1.5x the soaks of leech-hide armor.                                                                                                             |

Same soaks as the Sky Raider Duster a lower dodge penalty. Looks fly as fuck, too. A very highly valued item.                                                                                                     |

=====Exo Gear=====
Special note on the exo armor pieces, <del>likely the best soaks the game has to offer.</del> Exosuits are hamstringed by the fact that for everything that they soak, there is an endgame armor combination that soaks that damage better and is not as difficult to replace. Want to soak slash and stab? Double-layer leech. Scared of bullets? Caballero and kevlar. Even better, neither of these armor sets require that you run around trying to track down exo plates.

You can modify exosuits with certain items to increase their soaks in particular areas, but no matter what you modify them with, there will always be a corresponding endgame armor combination that soaks that damage better, while also soaking other damage types better.

The saving grace of exosuits is that they are marginally thinner than endgame combinations tend to be at 11 thickness, which means you can stick a deathsuit and deathshead beneath them. The resulting soaks can be better than many (but not all) other combinations. You'll also cover the whole body with uniformly solid soaks, while soaking electric damage well. These boons are still offset by the difficulty of replacing exosuits and deathgear compared to regular endgame armor, however, as well as the ATP inconvenience of deathgear.
