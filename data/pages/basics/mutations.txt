======Mutations======
Mutations offer you a means of rapid character development, as well as access to active abilities. Every few thousand xp, you're offered an additional mutation slot, which you may fill with a corresponding mutation. Their locations are documented in Injection Junction in Freedom City (marked IJ on your map).

Many mutations have downsides that accompany their perks. All of them, at the very least, take up a valuable mutation slot. Some are further limited; you can only have three "soak" mutations, for instance. Other times, some mutations are incompatible with others, like Zombie and Hyperimmune. Finally, all mutation choices are almost permanent; mutations can only be removed with the demutation chamber on Stormfront, which is a difficult and costly process. With all these factors in mind, it's smart to consider your mutation choices carefully. Some mutations require others in order for you to take them. Information regarding individual mutations is available in their respective help files.

=====Skin Mutations=====
Soak mutations (or "Skin mutations") are limited to three per player. Level 2 mutations are all upgrades to level 1 mutations and require their level 1 counterpart. You can have 3 soak mutations in total, consisting of either three level 1 mutations or two level 1 and one level 2.

| Lithodermis    | Your skin becomes more dense and stony, helping you resist broken limbs, knockouts, beatings, falling, and brain damage.  However your added weight impairs climbing and swimming, and forces you to carry less weight in gear.

=====Movement Mutations=====
Movement or mobility mutations are perks that add scouting or mobility options to a character. They currently come in three "paths", and only one path can be chosen: Phaser, Clairvoyance, or Leapfrog, plus its respective upgrade, and none of the others. 

Except for Leapfrog you must have a Psi Amp in hand (or be a [[hideous freak]]) to use these.

| Clairvoyance  | You gain the power to see using not your eyes, but your mind. Shimmers of residual psychic energy become visible to you, as well as the presence of malevolent spirits. Since you no longer need eyes to see, you will be able to see in the dark, but too much psychic energy will cloud your senses. You will also be able to project your consciousness, separating it from your body. This will allow you to invisibly wander the world.\\ \\ <color #22b14c>+3 focus</color>\\ <color #22b14c>You have perfect vision in all conditions</color>\\ <color #22b14c>Can see psi shimmers left by other projecting clairvoyants</color>\\ ''scan'' command: Detect projections and ghost on current tile\\ ''pulse'' command: Give nearby projected players psiblock\\ ''project'' command: Project your consciousness around the map in an invisible ghost form\\ ''whisper'' command: Covertly whisper messages to people while projecting\\ \\ <color #ed1c24>**Incompatible with: All other level 1 movement mutations, Jammer**</color>  | Luskentyre, \\ Cave of All Souls  | Medium   |

| Flight    | Combining your enhanced legs and bones with a focused psychic boost, you can actually leap into the air and take flight! Gives you the ability to fly, climb, dive and land - imagine a faster jetpack that doesn't blow up. This makes it a neat choice for low Focus builds that will neither go Blink nor Medium.\\ \\ ''fly'' command: Launch yourself into the sky.\\ ''land x'' command: Land on something.\\ ''dock with x'' command: Dock with another flying object, like the Skydock.\\ ''climb'' command: Increase your altitude.\\ ''dive'' command: Decrease your altitude.\\ ''fall'' command: Stop flying and fall to the ground. Largely useless.  | Mount Fisty, \\ Summit          |
| Medium    | Allows you to seek out other players and some NPCs. The higher your focus, the more accurate the roll. If your focus is high enough, you will accurately pinpoint the area that they currently reside. However they will be able to either detect that someone is seeking them and if their focus is high enough they will detect who is seeking them, or even detect where they are being sought from. Seek your targets with care!\\ \\ <color #22b14c>+1 focus</color>\\ <color #22b14c>You can see auras around other players</color>\\ ''seek'' command: Uses focus to ascertain a player or mob's location.                                                  | Stormfront Island               |
| Blink     | Gives you the ability to blink to a random place using focus. If your focus is high enough, you can also successfully ''blink <area>'' for precise transportation. The higher your focus, the lower the chance of blinking to an undesired location. Regardless of that, you will always have the risk of telefragging (blinking into a tile with someone else in it, causing you to explode). It has an interesting effect when combined with Hooligan.\\ \\ ''blink'' command: Can either randomly teleport, or teleport to a specified zone.                                                                                                                    | Necropolis Heart, \\ Labyrinth  |

=====Focus Mutations=====
Radically different from Hell, Psionics utilize both psionic amplifiers found in the world and psi points in order to utilize active abilities. The effectiveness of these mutations do not scale up with focus skill, but you must have a certain amount (around 20 total) to use them successfully.

You must have Psi Amp in hand (or be a [[hideous freak]]) to use these.

=====Racial Mutations=====
These are some of the most powerful mutations, and all of them fundamentally change a character's playstyle in some way. Many players take one and plan their entire build around it. Most of these are mutually exclusive with each other.

| [[Robot]]          | Become a walking, talking machine. You won't benefit from much in the way of drugs and you'll leech off other people's electricity like a jerk, but you WILL gain the ability to repair yourself. Additionally, you gain access to a line of robot-exclusive implants such as a long range scanner and a set of flaming fists.

=====Radiation Mutations=====
Radiation mutations are given randomly per tick at around 10 rads and don't actually take up any mutation slots. Though some of them are good, most of them are negative and they are always removed upon recloning.

=====Mutation Slots=====
To acquire a mutation you require a free mutation slot (radiation mutations are exempt from this). You begin with one free slot. To gain additional mutation slots, you must acquire a set amount of XP (note however, that this looks at total acquired XP, not XP available for use). Your first two additional slots come at 4,000 XP intervals, then a third at 5000 additional XP, and a fourth 7000 additional XP. After this, 10,000 additional XP is required.
