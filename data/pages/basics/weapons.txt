======Weapons======
=====Universal Weapon Data=====
====Damage Types====
Below is a listing of damage types in MKUV. Taking damage of any type has a chance to damage [[List_of_Armor|armor]], stun, [[Buffs and Debuffs|inflict shock]], cause [[Medic#Status_Effects|brain damage]] on head hits or even KO on head/face/groin hits.
|Type|Associated weapons|Notes|
|Beat|Blunt weapons, waster shells, buckshot shells.|Can break limbs and has a higher chance to knockout on a head/face/groin shot. Broken limbs debuff dodge/weapon skills and put you in shock if they get hit again.|
|Slash|Edged weapons, bolo shells, fletch shells.|High chance to inflict bleeding. Can cause castration on lucky hits.|
|Stab|Pointed weapons, needle pistol/rifle.|High chance to inflict bleeding.|
|Bullet|Firearms, Pistol Hammer.|Above average chance to inflict bleeding.|
|Explode|Bombs, Thumper magazines, plane crashes, telefragging, etc|High chance to break limbs, cause bleeding and inflict stun. Will also gib corpses if the finishing blow is explosive.|
|Burn|Flame chains, fire, plasma rifles, ash beasts, incendiary shells. Being on fire and overheating.|Can light enemies on fire, inflicting damage over time and debuffing weapon skills. The damage from being on fire/overheating is only soaked by Firewalker and Solar Sponge.|
|Electricity|Flash whips, electric shells, tesla gauntlets, electrical devices in water, etc.|High chance to inflict stun and shock. Slight chance to inflict burning.|
|Acid|Venomous Whips, Sagebrushes, Freakbiles, Corrosive Pikes, Corpclave chemical traps etc.|Nothing special.|
|Radiation|Having lots of rads in your system, some enemies.|Unsoakable - not to be confused with background radiation that only doses you with rads.|
|Irradiation|Abomination claws, waster shells, some enemies.|Chance to dose the victim with rads (the same you receive from background radiation exposure).|
|Wasting|Ectoblast ammo, Gulfhounds, starving, thirst.|Only soakable by Zombies and some enemies.|
|Suffocation|Ice yetis, Ashbeasts, drowning, space (decompression)|Only soakable by Zombies.|
|Cold|Ectoblast ammo, Gulfhounds, Iceblox ammo, environments, etc.|Can cause the cold status effect, which inflicts damage over time and debuffs brawn, reflexes, endurance and senses.|
|EMP|Crystal Spikes, Illuminol Clips, EMP Shotguns, Proton Packs, EMP mods/grenades, etc.|Only hurts robots/ghosts, but is very good at that. Has a chance of inflicting shock as well as Crazy damage on enemies with high focus.|
|Bleed|Sonic Scalpels, Chainsaws, Chudstoppers, bleeding.|Causes bleeding, which inflicts damage over time and may lead to a knockout if too much blood is lost. Generally considered unsoakable.|
|Crazy|Brainscrambler|Inflicts random mentals.|
|Drugs|Types: Overdose, Heart Attack|These are how drugs and heart attacks kill you.|
|Misc|Types: Internal, Healing, Scalding, Detonation, Rape, Drug_Burning|These are undocumented and sometimes unused. Detonation is related to Explode.|

====Parry Classes====
|Name|Icon|Notes|
|Non-parrying|-|Does not parry, and cannot be parried. (can still be dodged unless it's a gun/bow)|
|Class 0| |Can only parry other PC0 weapons.|
|Class 1|*|Can parry PC0 and other PC1 weapons.|
|Class 2|**|Can parry PC0, PC1 and PC2 weapons.|

====Weapon mods====
Most weapons can take [[weapon mods]]. See the linked article for more information on them. Some melee weapons have restricted mod pools; where applicable, examples of this are noted on this page. Gun mod compatibilities vary widely, and are instead noted in their own table in the [[weapon_mods#gun_mods|gun mods]] section of the weapon mods page.

=====Weaponry Listings=====
Here are the big lists, sorted by weapon class. Some tips on getting the most out of the stats listed here:
  * Don't judge weapons by their base damage since most of them benefit massively from [[Brawn]] and skill scaling. 
  * Melee weapons depend on [[Reflexes]] for speed, while firearms and bows depend on [[Brawn]] for speed. 
     * Focus/Psi weapons are an exception; to hit, speed, and damage is all based on your focus.
  * For melee weapons only their primary damage type will scale up with brawn and skill. Other damage types (like the extra stab on the katana, for example) will not scale higher than their listed base damage.
  * Any weapons with brawn scaling (including weapons modded with monowire kits) will scale negatively for characters with less than 8 brawn.
  * Skill scaling math is weird and usually comes out to be lower than the equivalent value in brawn scaling.
  * Firearms and bows do not gain any damage scaling.
  * All weapons have a dodge penalty calculated by the weapon's weight in kg.
  * The mechanics behind crits remain obscure, but some people believe they increase the chance to proc status effects and increase damage by 50% (so if you hit for 4 damage and it's a critical, the new total would be 6).

|Class|Stats|Notes|
|[[Firearms]]|Reflexes, Cool|Firearms can't parry, nor can they be dodged or parried. Shot damage is also notoriously hard to soak.|
|[[Quickdraw|Bows]]|Reflexes, Cool|Bows use similar rules to firearms and have the ability to power attack. The skill also affects your speed at drawing things in combat.|
|[[Blades]]|Reflexes, Cool|Blades have some synergy with firearms and are a popular choice for style reasons.|
|[[Clubs]]|Reflexes, Brawn|Clubs have brawn as one of their main stats and naturally get more damage from brawn scaling.|
|[[Throwing]]|Reflexes, Brawn|Thrown weapons use similar rules to flails. The skill also affects your ability to throw things in general.|
|[[Whips]]|Reflexes, Senses|Whips are unique for sharing the same stats as dodge, but are all PC0 as a tradeoff.|
|[[Spears]]|Reflexes, Endurance|Spears have an innate bonus to parrying and other advantages that come with higher endurance.|
|[[Fists]]|Brawn, Endurance|Fists have the advantages of brawn and endurance, and can get pretty fast at the cost of build flexibility.|
|[[Focus]]|Senses, Endurance|Focus weapons use similar rules to flails and are powered by psi points. This skill also determines how well you use focus mutations.|
|[[Flails]]|Senses, Brawn|Most flails can't parry or be parried, though they can still be dodged. Any object can be crafted into a custom flail.|
|[[Fish]]|Cool, Endurance|Fishing rods can be weaponized for some reason. Uses similar rules to flails.|
|[[Science]]|Brains|(WIP) Most science weapons act like guns and deal exotic damage most armors can't soak.|
|[[Bombs]]|Brains, Cool|(WIP) Not a weapon skill per se, but governs your ability to use bombs.|
