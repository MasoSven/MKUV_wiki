======Implants======
Cybernetic implants can be installed into your body, with various effects:

  * Stat implants will give you a specific boost to a stat at the cost of multiplying incoming stress by a certain amount.
  * Utility implants typically have functions other than boosting your stats and do not affect stress gain as much.
  * Explosive implants (cortex bombs) are put into you by a corp, or jail to kill you whenever they so desire.

Dr. Nick in Injection Junction (IJ) in northeastern Freedom City can install them into you for cheap as well as Meatwad in Weezer Sewers. Simply give the implant to your chosen doctor, respond with a "yes" or a nod, and he'll install it at a price that varies according to the price of the implant. He'll also slightly hurt you and cause bleeding. If you change your mind, but have already given him your implant, don't panic. They will give it back to you before you leave the clinic.

Players can install implants for you on the top floor of the hospital in Slagtown, using the same device that removes them. Note that removing implants takes high Medic skill; around 20 at minimum.

Implants can be bought at the Enhancement Clinic in Corpclave, The Neo You in Maas Neotek, and Kowloon Wirehead in Botany Bay. You can wear as many as you want, but repeats are not allowed, and wearing too many will give you regular ticks of stress. Note that your [[cool]] total affects how many implants you can hold before getting stress ticks.

Implants have a condition system, similar to that of armor. They won't be damaged if your corpse vanishes, but having your implants carved out of you by a poor scavenger tends to damage them. Damaged implants will cause multiplied stress ticks compared to pristine implants. Any implant with 6/10 condition or less also have the possibility of causing random minor injuries, shock, stress or even mental illnesses. All of them will be destroyed outside of the condition system if the unfortunate bearer dies an explosive death.

Implants do not act like conventional items in that they are not protected by cocoons. They will be hackable from your corpse should you die, unless you have the Silicone Skin mutation.

Players with decent Appraise skill can determine the exact condition of implants.
|Condition|What it really means|Description|
|Nothing|10/10|Perfectly usable with no side effects.|
|dinged/bit damaged|9-7/10|Usable, but with multiplied stress ticks.|
|somewhat/seriously/etc damaged|6/10 and less|Occasionally stuns, stresses and damages the user. Rarely causes mentals.|
